# Cat-Laser

- Check out the code in the "cat_laser" folder. I designed the files to be pretty modular so you can run "Vision.py" on its own and get a feel for how the tracking works.
- This repo contains everything needed to recreate this project: python code, Arduino code, wiring diagrams, and 3d models to print the turret!
